# Doorbell Pin Daemon

This is a simple program for controlling a Doorbell using a Raspberry Pi. With minor modifications this system should be usable with any Linux system that can control GPIOs via sysfs. Everything from board designs to the systemd service are included. This is still in development and ideally will be deployable as just a debian package on the Pi eventually.
